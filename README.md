In the spring of 2021, I experienced a severe allergic reaction to air pollution in downtown Ithaca, something I learned was related to weather patterns. This repository reports the data analysis I conducted from a sensor I installed on my back porck, as well as two other sensors. Sensor identifiers and GPS data have been anonymized for privacy reasons.
